# Optimizing-User-Group-and-Role-Management-with-Access-Control-and-Workflows-NM


### 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the management of users, groups, and roles within the ServiceNow environment by implementing efficient **Access Control (ACLs)** and **automated workflows**.  
The goal is to ensure secure data handling, streamline task approvals, and optimize administrative operations through automation.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Platform:** ServiceNow
- **Tools:** Flow Designer, Table Configuration, Access Control Lists (ACL)
- **Language:** JavaScript (for business rules)
- **Modules:** User Management, Task Table 2, Project Table NM

---

### 🧠 Project Objective
To **automate and secure user, group, and role management** by implementing workflow-based approvals and access controls.  
The system ensures that:
- Only authorized users can update records.
- Workflow approvals (e.g., from Alice) are required for status changes.
- Task progress and completion are tracked automatically.

---

### 🧾 Problem Statement
Manual management of user access and task approvals often leads to:
- Delayed task completions  
- Unauthorized updates  
- Inconsistent access control across roles  

This project addresses these issues by using **ServiceNow Flow Designer** to automate approvals and enforce **ACL-based data protection**.
